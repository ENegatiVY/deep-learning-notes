# Structure machine learning project

## week1

### 1.1 why ML
- this course mainly focus on the strategies to  analyzing a machine learning problem
- a lot of experience in building and shipping network

### 1.2 orthogonalization
- during building a network ,we should have different strategy for diffrent problem we might come across

such as

|problem|solution|
| ---------------  | ------------------------ |
|work bad on training set|try diffrent algrithm|
|work bad on dev set| get bigger training set|
|work bad on test set| get bigger dev set|

- this course will focus on waht exactly is the bottleneck to your system's performance

### 1.3 single number evaluation metric
